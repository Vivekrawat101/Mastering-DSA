# 🧠 Mastering DSA — Building Algorithmic Thinking

Welcome to **Mastering DSA**, a curated and structured journey focused on building strong algorithmic thinking and mastering data structures and algorithms through problem solving.

This repository is a long-term archive of topic-wise challenges, pattern-based practice, and optimized solutions, aimed at preparing for top-level coding interviews and real-world system thinking.

---

## 🚀 What This Repo Covers

- 📚 Core DSA Concepts: Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Stacks, Queues, Heaps, Hashing, and more
- 🧠 Pattern-Based Problem Solving: Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Greedy, Backtracking, DP, Binary Search, Recursion, Bit Manipulation, etc.
- 🔍 Dry Run + Optimization Focus: Visual traces, time/space complexity reasoning, and efficient logic building
- 📈 Topic-wise Folders + Day-wise Challenges (e.g. 21-Day Array Mastery)

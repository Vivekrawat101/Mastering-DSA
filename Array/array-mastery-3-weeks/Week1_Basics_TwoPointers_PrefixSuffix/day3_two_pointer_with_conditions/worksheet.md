# ðŸ“˜ Day 3: Two Pointer with Conditions

## âœ… Topics Covered
- In-place updates using two pointers
- Remove duplicates in sorted arrays
- Move zeroes to end while keeping order
- Merge sorted arrays efficiently

---

## ðŸ§  Concept Notes

Two Pointer (with conditions):
- You maintain two indices: one that reads, one that writes/swaps.
- Powerful for **sorted arrays**, **in-place modification**, and **real-time cleanup**.

Common tricks:
- Fast and slow pointer (read-write pattern)
- Zero trap + swap technique
- Backward merging to avoid shifting

## ðŸ§ª Dry Run Tasks

1. Dry run `remove_duplicates([1,1,2,2,3])` â€” track `i` and `j`.
2. Manually trace `move_zeroes([0,1,0,3,12])` â€” mark swaps.
3. Merge `nums1=[1,3,5,0,0,0]`, `nums2=[2,4,6]` and walk backwards.

# ðŸ“˜ Day 2: Two Pointer Techniques (Leftâ€“Right Traversal)

Learn how to use two pointers effectively on arrays â€” especially sorted ones â€” to avoid brute force and improve to O(n).

## âœ… Topics to Learn

- [ ] Two Pointer for Pair Search (sorted array)
- [ ] Reverse Array using Two Pointers
- [ ] In-place Shifting (Move Zeros, Remove Duplicates)
- [ ] Real-world use cases (Container Problem, Palindrome Check)

## ðŸ§  Concept Notes

### ðŸ”¹ Two Pointers
- Use left and right index to eliminate nested loops
- Example: `while left < right:` â€” move based on condition

### ðŸ”¹ Pair Search in Sorted Array
- If `arr[i] + arr[j] > target` â†’ decrease `j`
- If `arr[i] + arr[j] < target` â†’ increase `i`

### ðŸ”¹ Reverse Array
- Swap `arr[left]` and `arr[right]`, then move both inward

### ðŸ”¹ In-Place Zero Movement
- Maintain a slow pointer to track position for non-zero elements

## ðŸ§ª Dry Run Tasks

- [ ] Dry run two sum with `[1,2,3,4,6]` and target `6`
- [ ] Reverse `[10, 20, 30, 40]` using two pointers
- [ ] Move zeros in `[0,1,0,3,12]` in-place

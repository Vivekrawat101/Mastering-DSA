# ðŸ“˜ Day 6: Review and Mixed Practice

## âœ… Topics
- Prefix Sum + Two Pointer Review
- Mixed patterns and problem types
- Applying Day 1â€“5 learning in practical problems

---

## ðŸ§  Concept Notes

- This day is designed to **reinforce learning** and make connections across techniques.
- Many real problems involve combining multiple patterns (prefix sum + two pointer + conditions).
- Revisit your past weak spots and dry-run before coding.

---

## ðŸ§ª Dry Run Tasks

1. Take `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` â€” how many subarrays sum to `5`?
2. Can two elements in `[1, 3, 4, 7]` form a sum of `10`?
3. Whatâ€™s the minimum subarray length in `[1, 4, 4]` with sum â‰¥ 8?

## ðŸ’» Conceptual Coding Questions

### ðŸŸ¢ Easy 1: Count Subarrays With Fixed Sum
Filename: `code/count_subarrays_with_sum.py`

---

### ðŸŸ¢ Easy 2: Pair Sum Exists (Unsorted Version)
Filename: `code/pair_sum_unsorted.py`

---

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium: Max Subarray with Sum â‰¤ K (Prefix + Two Pointers)
Filename: `code/max_subarray_sum_leq_k.py`

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Goal
- Solidify combined thinking: prefix + pointer
- Build speed and confidence in reading conditions
- Transition from learning to applying in contests/interviews

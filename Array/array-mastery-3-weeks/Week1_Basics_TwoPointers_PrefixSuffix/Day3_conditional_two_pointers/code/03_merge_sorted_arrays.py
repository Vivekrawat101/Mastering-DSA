Merge Two Sorted Arrays (In-Place)
----------------------------------
Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.
nums1 has a size equal to m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements to merge,
and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored.

Example:
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3
       nums2 = [2,5,6],       n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]

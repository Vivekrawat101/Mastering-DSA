# ðŸ“˜ Day 7: Mock Test and Recap

## âœ… Topics
- Combined review of Prefix Sum and Two Pointer
- Apply knowledge under light time pressure
- Analyze brute vs optimized decisions

---

## ðŸ§  Concept Notes

- This mock test is designed to simulate a **real interview setting**.
- No new concepts â€” just deep application of what you've learned in Week 1.
- Carefully read each problem, dry-run before coding, and track your speed.

---

## ðŸ§ª Mock Test Rules

- Spend ~60 minutes solving all 3 problems.
- You may look at notes but try to think without peeking.
- After solving, revisit your approach: could it be smarter? More optimized?

## ðŸ’» Mock Test Questions

### ðŸŸ¢ Easy: Count Subarrays with Even Sum (Prefix)
Filename: `code/count_even_sum_subarrays.py`

---

### ðŸŸ¢ Easy: Valid Pair Exists (Sorted Two Pointer)
Filename: `code/valid_pair_sorted.py`

---

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium: Count Subarrays with Sum in Range [L, R] (Prefix + Two Pointer)
Filename: `code/count_subarrays_sum_range.py`

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Goal
- Test what youâ€™ve learned, not just what youâ€™ve memorized.
- Spot where brute force creeps in and replace it with optimized flow.
- Build confidence heading into Week 2!

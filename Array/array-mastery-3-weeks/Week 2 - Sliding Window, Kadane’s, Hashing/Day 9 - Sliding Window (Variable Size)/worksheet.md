# ðŸ“˜ Day 9 - Sliding Window (Variable Size)

## âœ… Topics
- Variable size sliding window
- Shrink-expand patterns for sum-based conditions

---

## ðŸ§  Concept Notes
Sliding window of variable size is useful when:
- The size of the window depends on a constraint (like sum or product)
- You want to minimize or maximize the size dynamically

### Common Logic:
Use two pointers `start` and `end` to maintain the window, expand `end`, and shrink `start` when constraints are violated.

## ðŸ§ª Dry Run Tasks
Try dry-running these manually:
- `[2, 1, 5, 2, 3, 2]`, target = 7 â†’ What's the smallest window with sum >= 7?
- `[1, 2, 1, 0, 1]`, k = 4 â†’ Whatâ€™s the longest window with sum <= 4?

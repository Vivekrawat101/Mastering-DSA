## 📂 Folder Structure

```
dayX_topic_name/
|-- code/         # Python solutions with comments

## 💡 Goals

- Master array-based problem-solving for interviews and data engineering roles  
- Train smart coding techniques (O(n), O(1)) and avoid brute-force  
- Build confidence through consistency and deep understanding  

---

Then open each `dayX_.../` folder and follow this workflow:

1. 🧠 Read the `worksheet.md`  
2. 🧪 Do dry runs manually  
3. 💻 Practice problems in the `code/` folder  
4. 📝 Reflect or document in `notes/`

## 📌 Why I'm Doing This

I'm preparing for top data engineering roles and want to build strong foundations in algorithmic thinking.  
This challenge is my personal roadmap to mastering problem-solving patterns that actually show up in interviews and real-world systems.  

It also serves as my **daily proof of consistency and improvement**.
